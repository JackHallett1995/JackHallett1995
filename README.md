# Hi, I'm Jack! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I've been working as a **Web Developer** since September 2019, and I've gained solid experience with:
- **WordPress**, including building custom solutions with **PHP**, **JavaScript**, and **Gutenberg blocks**.
- **React Native** for mobile app developmentâ€”exploring new ways to create smooth, cross-platform experiences.
- Right now, I'm diving deeper into **frontend development** with **React** and **Next.js** to keep improving my skills and build more dynamic, high-performance web apps.

I plan to keep this repository updated regularly with personal projects Iâ€™m working on, as I experiment with new technologies and improve my coding abilities. Youâ€™ll find everything from smaller, fun side projects to more substantial applications I build along the way.
